# OurSolutionSkilltest Component

This component implements the "Our solution: skilltest" screen converted from the Figma-exported static assets.

Notes:
- Images are referenced from `/assets/...` and must exist in `public/assets`.
- Styles are scoped in `OurSolutionSkilltest.css` and rely on app-level CSS variables from `src/App.css`.
- Update images in the markup if new Figma assets are provided.
